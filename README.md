- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucidkuki and I also go by the name of Aleksandra sometimes. Cat lover, plant nurturer. In my spare time I love solving jigsaw puzzles, improving my anxious self and learning to love the life I've created for myself. 
- 👀 I’m interested in web design, web development and QA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL and manual testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking for ways to practice manual testing online for free in order to get more confident when applying for jobs as I am transfering from Chemistry to the IT field.
